# Oops!
## This short-link doesn't seem to be active.
This may be because there is no NHS Hack Day event ongoing or it may not have been set-up for this event yet.

If you are at an event look out for alternative links that may be on notice boards/posters/presentations or check Twitter: [@NHSHackDay](https://twitter.com/NHSHackDay), [#nhshd](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nhshd) for up-to-date info.

Here are some helpful links instead:
