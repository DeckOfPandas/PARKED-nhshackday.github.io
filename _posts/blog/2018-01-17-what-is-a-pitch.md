If you're new to NHS Hack Day (and even if you're not), the thought of pitching your idea to an entire room of people is quite daunting.

Let's cover the **What** and **Who** bits first.

## What is a pitch?

A pitch is a short opportunity for a person to share a project idea to tempt others to work on it with them.

At the start of NHS Hack Day, anyone with a problem or project they think might be interesting to other attendees can speak for up to 60 seconds to explain it to the rest of the group.

Based on these short pitches, other attendees decide what they’d like to spend time on on during the weekend.

The pitches are short, and so it is not possible to use slides or to show demos on the projector. This is almost always a good thing - you can focus on making your explanation as clear to as many people as possible.

If you really need to show something (you probably don't), you could hold up a sheet of flipchart paper (we’ll have lots of this) - but try not to over-complicate or over-think it :)

## Who should pitch?

NHS Hack Day is an opportunity for anyone with an idea that they'd like to explore or a problem they have in their day-to-day work that they think could be helped by a NHS Hack Day project, or would otherwise be of interest to other NHS Hack Day attendees.

The weekend will be a great opportunity for you to learn about what other people in your sector are doing, and how they’re addressing the problems they face; but of course this will work best if everyone buys in.

## I'm still not sure

Ok - so now you can see that you are **totally** the sort of person who should pitch at NHS Hack Day, but you're still not sure?

Here are some concerns people have had in the past:

### I'm not very good at presenting to audiences

Firstly, you are probably a whole load better at it than you think you are - but it's all good anyway.

The NHS Hack Day community does not attract polished speakers with years of presentation experience - it attracts people just like you and I - with the same apprehensions.

The quick-fire pitching style is actually fun - it is so different to a formal presentation that people won't even think about the sort of things you're worried about.

And if you're still not sure: talk to an organiser or hang back down the queue a bit, watch some other people pitch first, and then see how you feel. Every hack event I've been to has had at least one last minute idea pitched where someone gets inspired by the other pitches. And no one will even notice if you decide not to go ahead. :)

### My idea is not developed enough to be interesting or useful

Definitely not! Some of the best ideas are the ones that still have plenty of room to be developed. And that's why we're at NHS Hack Day right?

People come to NHS Hack Day *either* to work on an idea or problem they have or to get stuck in helping other people develop their ideas.

Your pitch might be as simple as describing a problem that you've encountered - and there will be people in the audience for whom that is enough for them to get problem-solving with you.

You might have a clear idea, but feel like you developed the 'how' enough yet - that's great! Tell everyone this - ask them to help you work out the 'how'. Again, this will be a really interest proposition for people.

There is no idea too small or too early to pitch - and you'll get a feel for this as soon as you see other people pitching.

### My idea isn't interesting enough, or the other ideas will be more interesting

Interesting is a really personal thing - you really can't guess what will or won't be interesting to other people.

NHS Hack Day often ends up with only 50% of the original pitches actually being worked on - this is entirely normal, and is a result of the self-organising that happens at these events.

It is possible that your pitch doesn't make it all the way to the end of the weekend, but this is not a reflection of quality, interest, value, or you! You might even decide that you'd rather work on someone else's idea (this happens ALL the time).

## Give pitching a go

Don’t be shy: do consider having a go at pitching. Your friends at NHS Hack Day are probably the best people you could do this with.
