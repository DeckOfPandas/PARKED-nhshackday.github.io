    <h3>Something here</h3>
    <p>Here is Wikipedia&#8217;s definition of a hack day:</p>
    <quote>A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects. Occasionally, there is a hardware component as well. Hackathons typically last between a day and a week. Some hackathons are intended simply for educational or social purposes, although in many cases the goal is to create usable software</quote>
    <p>That sounds a bit scary. It isn&#8217;t.</p>

            <p>Hack Days are a fun way to brainstorm collaboratively and come up with quick solutions. Making actual "products" isn't necessarily the aim; it's about having a great time, learning something and meeting some brilliant people. The main advantage of Hack Days is having people with a wide range of skills all in the same room and working together, something which may not be achieved quite so explicitly during day jobs in software development. What makes NHS Hack Days different is that we are committed to welcoming people who don’t necessarily have computer skills to our events. We want everyone with diverse interest in healthcare technology: healthcare professionals, patients and their relatives, representatives from charities, and anyone else who wants to help out, or even just to see what we’re doing.</p>

            <p>Day One: Saturday:</p>
<p>Over coffee, anyone with an idea pitches it to all attendees (see How can I pitch an idea? link below)  You then get to chat with the people and find out what group you’d like to work with.</p>,
<p>Groups form organically with some people joining several groups rather than committing to one project. You may choose to join a particular group because you were inspired by the pitch, or because you have skills you think might be useful, or for any reason at all. t's all very freeform.</p>
<p>In the evening, each group shares what they have been working on.</p>
<p>Day Two: Sunday</p>
<p>We start off with more coffee and get straight to work.  In the afternoon, each group gives a short presentation about what they have achieved, and we invite a panel of judges to watch these and decide how to award various prizes. </p>
<p>It's not about "products" or "winning", but offering prizes is our way of incentivising innovation, and perhaps gives you a little something in return for your time. Having credible external judges helps everyone feel like they're part of something real, and it's always interesting to hear feedback on ideas from practising clinicians, working developers, real patients, people involved in policy or whoever we are fortunate enough to have on the judging panel.</p>
