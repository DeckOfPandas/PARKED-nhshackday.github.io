title: Open BNF #Mobile Formulary
about: "Open BNF was built as an exploratory research project at an NHS Hack Day to explore better ways of providing health professionals with access to drug dosage information via their mobile phones whilst they are working on wards.\n

It was built by a group of doctors and developers who gave up their weekend and to try and make the NHS run a bit smoother.\n

Since this is a research project it should not be used in real medical situations; [BNF.org](https://www.bnf.org/) remains the definitive source, and the copyright of the data remains theirs.\n

There are plans to talk to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain to see how to best collaborate."
