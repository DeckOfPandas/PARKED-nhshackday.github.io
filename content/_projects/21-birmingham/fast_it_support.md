about: "Current helpdesk too busy and under resourced. Need a way to help clinicians get quicker access to support for common issues and provide self help that's user friendly. Hope to eventually automate common tasks in real time but in short term if users can't self help system will log a Support ticket via email with responses provided and also initiate other workflow for high impact issues such as those causing a site wide impact."
