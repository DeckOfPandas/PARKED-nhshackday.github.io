about: "Currently, obtaining consent for treatment and procedures is largely paper-based.\
  \ Typically, a patient will sign a paper consent form after a verbal discussion\
  \ with a clinician. OpenEHR has an archetype named \"Informed Consent\". The project\
  \ aims to build a simple web-based interface to allow \nclinicians to build structured\
  \ consent forms for procedures, trials or activities that patients can read, review\
  \ and attest (consent to). The digital record of consent is then added to the clinical\
  \ record."
