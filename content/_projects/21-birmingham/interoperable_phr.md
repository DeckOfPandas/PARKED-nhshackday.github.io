about: Very challenging as we were learning FHIR as we were going along, as well as
  having to create new services in our Azure instance and that was new too.  We got
  it working. Next time we'll bring API documentation so others can play with it to
  100% prove it (rather than us proving it)

summary: We have a patient online service and have just upgraded to an interoperable
  FHIR back end data store. We wanted to see if a 3rd party app could connect to the
  back end.
