about: "Faxes bad.\nInstant Messaging (IM) good.\n\nClinically appropriate IM is good\
  \ for doctor to doctor communication.  For doctor to role communication (like cardiologist\
  \ on call), Medxnote provides a 'virtual pager' solution allowing clinicians to\
  \ subscribe to specific roles.  \n\nIn this example doctors are subscribing to @cardiology\
  \ in the hospital environment, so they can receive referrals.\n\nWhat's good about\
  \ this approach is:\n\n1.  IM centric, very shallow learning curve.\n2.  It distinguishes\
  \ between the user and the role.\n3.  It allows for multiple subscribers to roles\
  \ and multiple roles per subscriber.\n4.  It can operate in parallel to fax.\n5.\
  \  It doesn't require a waterfall approach across an entire Trust, hospital, etc\
  \ to make an impact.\n6.  It's a solution that's repeatable across multiple areas,\
  \ not just cardiology.\n7.  It's a repurposing of existing proven technologies and\
  \ is available for implementation today."

summary: Sending faxes in critical care situations is cumbersome and requires double
  checking and safety netting, making it an inefficient means of communicating critical
  information.  At the same time, faxes are universal. How can you replace faxes,
  one use case at a time?  Secure Instant Messaging, with role based 'virtual pager'
  allows for secure, compliant, auditable, verifiable and FAST information transfer.
