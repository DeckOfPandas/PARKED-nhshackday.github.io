about: "The GNCR (as many other shared record projects) use the MIG to access GP data.\
  \  The project was implemented quickly in the region with Trusts working collaboratively\
  \ to implement the MIG viewer.  However, it costs the region around \xA30.5m pa\
  \ and isn't built on reusable standards.  It's served us well, but we want to use\
  \ GP connect instead but it must be launchable in context from the clinician's EPR.If\
  \ we can get a Proof of concept live, we can spread and share around the region\
  \ and save \xA30.5m"
