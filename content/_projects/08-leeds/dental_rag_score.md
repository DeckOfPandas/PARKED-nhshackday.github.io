title: "Dental RAG Score"
summary: "Dental disease impacts on quality of life. The new NHS dental contract requires preventative care to reduce the risk of dental disease.
Dental RAG Score is a web based tool for a traffic-light system (Red, Amber or Green), used to weight each clinical or patient factor according to it’s importance in determining future risk for disease.
The RAG score will inform actions for patients and professionals to reduce the patient’s future risk from disease."
