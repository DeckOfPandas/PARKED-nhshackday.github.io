summary: "Retinopathy of prematurity is a potentially blinding condition that affects premature babies. Screening involves examination by an ophthalmologist. These infants should be seen according to a tight screening protocol.
Missing referral and screening can have sight threatening implications for the baby and major medico legal cost for the Hospital- NHS.
We are presenting a referral management tool for Retinopathy of prematurity alerts that will extract information via LH7 protocols and allow management of that information to a dedicated web portal."
