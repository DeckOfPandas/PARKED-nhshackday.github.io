summary: 'Help chemo patients decide what to do when they feel unwell. Send high-risk
  patients to the A&E, redirect medium risk patients to speak with a health professional
  and provide advice for lower risk patients. Lower the volume of calls on the services
  proving support and ensure high-risk patient get help asap. '
