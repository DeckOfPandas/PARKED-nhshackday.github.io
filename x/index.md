The NHS Hack Day model works.

For a long time the organising team have wondered about how to engage more specific parts of the NHS community while still maintaining our commitment to supporting health and care technology in its widest sense.

We have been approached by many groups who have suggested we run themed NHS Hack Days, such as "Mental Health", "Physiotherapy" or "VR". Others want to use our platform to reinvigorate their local teams without leaving the context of their day-to-day professional work behind completely.

We are thinking about:
* How can local organisations benefit from what we have learned about running hack days?

* Can we find a way for local events to use our assets outside the core NHS Hack Day brand without compromising our principles?

* How can we support local organisers to run events under our umbrella so our core organising team of volunteers don't have to give up their day jobs to run more than three events per year?

We don't have the answer to these things yet, but it's time to take an empirical approach.

**Enter NHSHDx Gloucester: an experiment in making big things local.**

The Gloucester Healthcare Community are organising and hosting the first NHSHDx on 13th April at the Redwood Education Centre, Gloucester Royal Hospital.
